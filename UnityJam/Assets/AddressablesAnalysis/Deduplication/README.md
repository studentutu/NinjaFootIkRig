# Addressables deduplication
Deduplicates Addressable assets but groups them by label so that fewer asset bundles get generated.

Basically the same as [AddressablesMemoryOptimizations](https://github.com/patrickdevarney/AddressablesMemoryOptimizations) but faster. See the accompanying blog post on [saving memory with Addressables](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2021/03/31/tales-from-the-optimization-trenches-saving-memory-with-addressables/) for details.
